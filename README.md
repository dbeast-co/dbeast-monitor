Welcome to the DBeast Monitor for Elastic Stack â€“ an open-source plugin for Grafana!

Our plugin provides a powerful UI for monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing of your Elastic Stack components -
Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.

## Key features

1. Multi-cluster support â€“ monitor and manage multiple Elasticsearch clusters from a single application.
2. Comprehensive dashboards providing monitoring and analytics for:
    - **Elastic Stack** overview
    - **Elasticsearch hosts** performance and health
    - **Elasticsearch Indices / index patterns** usage and metrics
    - **Elasticsearch shards** distribution and allocation
    - **Elasticsearch ingest pipelines** activity and throughput
    - **Elasticsearch tasks** progress and status
    - **Elasticsearch machine learning jobs** performance and status
    - **Logstash instances** performance and health
    - **Logstash pipelines** throughput and errors
3. Helm versions
    - The Helm charts can be found in our [Helm repository](https://github.com/dbeast-co/dbeast-monitor-helm)

## Documentation

The project documentation is available on our [wiki](https://github.com/dbeast-co/dbeast-monitor/wiki).

# Getting started

There are two plugin versions available (both are the same plugin but differ based on the environment variable
`DBEAST_MONITOR_VERSION`: either "Container" or "OnPrem" (default: OnPrem):

1. Regular (OnPrem) installation:  
   The OnPrem version includes only the application plugin. You will need to install and define Logstash separately for data
   shipment. The complete installation guid can be found in our [OnPrem installation instructions](https://github.com/dbeast-co/dbeast-monitor/wiki/Installation-Instructions).
2. Helm installation (Container version):  
   The Container version includes Grafana with pre-installed plugins and Logstash for data shipment.
   The complete installation guid can be found in our [Container installation instructions](https://github.com/dbeast-co/dbeast-monitor/wiki/Installation-Instructions-Container-Version).
3. The user guid for the adding new cluster can be found in the [OnPrem Add new cluster instructions](https://github.com/dbeast-co/dbeast-monitor/wiki/AddNewCluster) and [Container add new cluster instructions](https://github.com/dbeast-co/dbeast-monitor/wiki/AddNewClusterContainerVersion).

## Requirements

- Grafana: 10.1.0+
- Logstash: 8.1+
- Elasticsearch monitored cluster: 8+ (Elasticsearch 7X - partial support)
- Elasticsearch monitoring cluster: 8.7+
