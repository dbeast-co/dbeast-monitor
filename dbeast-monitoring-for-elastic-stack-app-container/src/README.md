# DBeast monitoring toolkit for Elastic Stack

Welcome to the DBeast Monitor for Elastic Stack â€“ a powerful open-source platform!

This platform provides a powerful UI for monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing of your Elastic Stack components -
Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. This application supports the monitoring of one or more clusters. Most of the data
used for the analytics is delivered by Beats and Logstash and stored in Elasticsearch. You can use your production
Elasticsearch cluster as the data storage, but we strongly recommend using a dedicated monitoring cluster.

The project documentation is available on our [wiki](https://github.com/dbeast-co/dbeast-monitor/wiki).
